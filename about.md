Hi, my name is Martin Yim. I'm a recent graduate of Boston University where I studied Economics with minors in Computer Science and Statistical Methods. While I enjoyed Economics, I yearned for a more practical, hands-on study removed from the far-away theorizing of Economics; I wanted to build things, tell stories, and learn about a variety of subjects.
