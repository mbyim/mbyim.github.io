<p>Every year, various outlets put out "Best of Year" articles for
various things. In this case, the <em>Financial Times</em> put out <a href="https://www.ft.com/booksof2023">Best Books
of 2023</a>, for several
subjects. I was curious what the effect would be on book sales –
especially because some of these books are more academic or obscure on
the whole. I don't have access to book sales data, but Goodreads does
have statistics on when people "add" books to their "shelves". Using
this publically available Goodreads data as a proxy for interest and
marketing effectiveness, we can try to estimate if the <em>Financial Times</em>
series had a significant effect on interest in the books featured (and
thus, presumably also book sales).</p>

<p>I made a few assumptions and caveats in this quick analysis. One
assumption was that two different goodreads action statistics could be
additive ("added" and "to-read"). Another was that I could try to
use the other books of authors' whose books were featured in the <em>Best
Of</em> series as a donor pool to create synthetic controls. Strong spikes
for different books at different times outside of the <em>FT Best Of</em>
publication dates I assume to be other, "exogenous"
marketing/publicity efforts. Lastly, while the <em>FT Best Of</em> series
contained many subject list <em>Best Of</em>s, I scoped the analysis to
Economics, History, and Politics, for ease and to restrict my
web-scraping volume.</p>

<p>Regarding methodology, I chose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_control_method">synthetic
control</a>
to try to estimate the effect. The gist of synthetic control is to
construct a counterfactual from donor units which then allows us to peer
into the un-seen, untreated outcomes of our treated units. It does this
using regression to find the weights which then are applied to the donor
units to properly mimic the treated unit's would-have-been future. The
method is fairly recent and gaining traction in the social science
literature.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons I chose synthetic control over other possible
methods. First, marketing mix models would be one possibility but they
are generally done internally where all marketing decision data is
available because they are effective when one has access to the full
data on marketing efforts – how "strong" those efforts were in dollar
terms, when they started and stopped, etc – which we don't have.
Second, after doing some reading on regression discontinuity in time, I
decided it had issues that were better addressed by synthetic control.
Synthetic control would better be able to deal with time-varying
unobservable variables. As said in <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23602/w23602.pdf">this
paper</a>:
"RDiT requires assumptions for identification that are often strong and
inherently untestable." While my application of synthetic control and
definition of the donor pool here are imperfect, I prefer it to RDiT –
and one might even argue that a simple pre-post analysis might also
suffice for most situations (as they do in the aforementioned paper).
But we're just having fun here, and I wanted to see what I could do
with synthetic control :).</p>

<p>To view the dataset from above we can use panelView (authored in part by
the same people who worked on gsynth, which we will introduce in a
moment). As we can see we have about 40 treated books, and roughly 250
untreated as our donor pool. We can also see the (slightly) staggered
treatment. We also have a significant size in terms of panel data,
covering a little over five months.<br />

<p>At first, borrowing heavily from code in <a href="https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/15-Synthetic-Control.html">Causal Inference for the
Brave and
True</a>,
I created a simple synthetic control model using our treated and
untreated books. I excluded about 10 books (treated and untreated) which
had very high pretreatment spikes, as these reflected exogenous
variation of other marketing efforts and which seemed to be heavily
biasing the model (see below). Outside of these outliers, I had two main
difficulties to deal with: one was that I had more than one treated unit
(about 40 in my case), and the other was that I realized after a bit
that the <em>Best Of</em> series was <em>not</em> all published on one day, so I
actually had three different treatment periods as well.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/image8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To deal with the issue of multiple treatment units I first attempted to
create synthetic controls for each treated unit and add the synthetic
control outcomes together. This model passed the smell test but it felt
a bit crude; I wanted to see what would happen if I collapsed the
treatment units into one, with an average. In the second attempt, I
aggregated the treated books into a single treated unit, and this time I
came up with a model that passed the smell test. However, after reading
<a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/616939/synthetic-control-method-based-on-several-treated-units">this stackexchange
post</a>,
I decided to make use of the gsynth package which could help me directly
address both my problems of multiple treated units and staggered
treatments with a proper methodology, as opposed to my jerry-rigged
solutions where I wasn't even addressing the staggered treatments (only
staggered one to two days).</p>

<p>The gsynth package implements <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/generalized-synthetic-control-method-causal-inference-with-interactive-fixed-effects-models/B63A8BD7C239DD4141C67DA10CD0E4F3">Generalized Synthetic
Control</a>,
which implements a variation on synthetic control using two way fixed
effects and a factor loading scheme. Importantly, it is able to
incorporate multiple treated units and staggered treatments. I should
note that it does have a trade off of interpretability: where synthetic
control restricts weights of its constituent donors to add to 1 and be
positive, generalized synthetic control is calculating factors and also
does not necessarily constrain them to add to 1 and all take on positive
values. As said in the paper: "estimated factors may not be directly
interpretable because they are, at best, linear transformations of the
true factors..."</p>

<p>After fitting the gysnth model, we can see that the overall results are
similar to the averaged out book model I created in python which didn't
properly address the multiple treatment unit or staggered treatment.
However the gsynth model here performs better <em>despite</em> the fact that I
did not exclude the outliers I mentioned above, which had severely
thrown off the original model (see
below).<img src="/assets/image2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To give a singular example of the results for a single treatment unit,
below are three graphs of Branko Milanovic's new book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/stats?id=123831773"><em>[Visions of
Inequality]{.underline}</em></a>,
the goodreads data (with a dotted line added for treatment date), the
actual versus the blue dotted synthetic control, and the gap.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/image4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Critically we can see that the model does not overfit, but also that it
does seem to be able to isolate the FT effect, even with the (perhaps
janky) definition of a donor pool that we used in this analysis.
Eyeballing, it seems as though the ATT really occurs over one to two
weeks before trailing off into residual noise. Though perhaps a simple
before-after eye test might have sufficed, I think this is a bit more
fun, and it was interesting to see how synthetic control would work. You
can find some of the (messy, quick – please excuse it) webscraping and
modeling code <a href="https://github.com/mbyim/goodreads_scraping">here</a> if you're interested.</p>
